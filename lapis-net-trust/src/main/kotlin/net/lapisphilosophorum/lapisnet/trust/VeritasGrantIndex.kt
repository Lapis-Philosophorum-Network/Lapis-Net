/**
 * Bounded, in-memory index of [VeritasGrant]s received (locally created or via gossip), keyed by
 * content id and by (truster, target) pair. This IS the local cache [VeritasGossip.currentGrants]
 * resolves over - it does not itself persist anything (that is Nabu's job, see [VeritasGossip])
 * and is never rebuilt by scanning storage at startup (Nabu has no "enumerate local CIDs"
 * primitive - see the architecture doc's known-gap note).
 *
 * [GrantContentId] (SHA-256 over a grant's canonical bytes, [VeritasGrant.contentId]) is a
 * completely different byte layout from a Nabu [io.ipfs.cid.Cid], even when computed over the
 * same underlying bytes - this index and [VeritasGrantResolver] key exclusively off
 * [VeritasGrant.contentId], never off a Nabu-returned `Cid`.
 *
 * **Eviction, not rejection, once full (round-2 M2 fix).** [grantsByContentId] is backed by an
 * access-order-capable [LinkedHashMap] whose `removeEldestEntry` override evicts the oldest
 * tracked entry once [maxTracked] is exceeded - mirrors `lapis-net-storage`'s
 * `BoundedRecordStore` pattern exactly. A full index therefore no longer hard-rejects new grants
 * (the previous behavior): it displaces its oldest tracked grant to make room instead. This
 * matters because, per the domain model, "revocation is not a special case, just a new grant with
 * value 0" - a hard-reject-when-full policy would let a cheap attacker who fills the shared cap
 * permanently prevent victims from ever seeing anyone's future trust updates, including a
 * legitimate revocation of a compromised/malicious party. [grantsByPair] (the reverse index
 * [grantsFor]/[allPairs] read from) is kept in sync on every eviction - see the
 * `removeEldestEntry` override below.
 *
 * (On the "access-order-capable" phrasing above, and why this is currently FIFO-equivalent rather
 * than true LRU: see [grantsByContentId]'s own doc comment.)
 *
 * **A second, SEPARATE bounded structure, [persistedContentIds], with a deliberately DIFFERENT
 * (non-evicting) policy, gates durable persistence (round-3 fix).** [canAccept] only ever
 * predicts exact-content-id duplication against [grantsByContentId] - since round-2's M2 change,
 * a full in-memory index evicts rather than rejects, so there is no "index is full" case left for
 * [canAccept] to report, which means it cannot bound [NabuStorage.put] calls on its own (that was
 * round-3's finding: gating persistence on [canAccept] alone silently stopped bounding disk
 * writes the moment M2 made the index evict). [persistedContentIds] and [tryReservePersistence]
 * exist purely to give persistence its own, independent cap. Unlike [grantsByContentId], this
 * structure never evicts - it is a hard, reject-once-full cap. That asymmetry is intentional, not
 * an oversight: the in-memory index backs this node's *live trust view*
 * ([VeritasGossip.currentGrants], and transitively [TrustGraph]/[TrustPathFinder]), which must
 * stay responsive to new grants (including revocations) even once full, so eviction is the
 * correct policy there. Durable persistence is a different resource with a different correctness
 * requirement: nothing reads the live trust view from disk (see [VeritasGossip]'s class doc
 * comment - the index is never rebuilt from `NabuStorage` at startup), and this wave's own design
 * already publishes full grant bytes over gossip rather than a CID pointer specifically because a
 * peer cannot be relied on to fetch content from another node later. So once this node's own
 * persistence cap is reached, declining to write further gossip-received grants to disk costs it
 * only its own restart-durability and Bitswap-serving ability for that specific late-arriving
 * content - an acceptable, already-precedented tradeoff (see [VeritasGossip]'s "known gaps" list)
 * - while a hard reject (rather than evicting an *already-durably-committed* older grant to make
 * room for a newer one) avoids the much worse alternative of silently un-persisting something this
 * node already promised the network it had stored.

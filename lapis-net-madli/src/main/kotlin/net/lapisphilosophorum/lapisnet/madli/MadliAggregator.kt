/**
 * Veritas-weighted, decay-weighted, weighted-MEDIAN aggregation of [MadliDailyVector]s about one
 * observed peer - the module's headline deliverable. Three manipulation defenses are combined:
 *
 *  1. **Veritas-weighting (anti-Sybil).** Each observer's contribution is scaled by the consumer's
 *     own Veritas score of that observer via [veritasObserverWeight] - a Sybil cluster with no
 *     external Veritas path from the consumer's own identity gets weight `0.0` and contributes
 *     nothing, no matter how many fabricated vectors it publishes.
 *  2. **Weighted MEDIAN, not mean (anti-selective-service / anti-minority-liar).** If 90% of
 *     (Veritas-weighted) observers report a peer as slow and 10% report it as fast, the weighted
 *     median follows the 90% majority - a peer that selectively serves a small minority of
 *     observers well cannot pull the aggregate value toward that minority's report the way a mean
 *     would.
 *  3. **One representative vector per observer per metric (anti-backdated-flooding).** `aggregate`
 *     groups the input by [MadliDailyVector.observer] and, independently for each of the five
 *     metrics, feeds the weighted median only ONE `(value, weight)` sample per observer - that
 *     observer's single vector with the highest decayed weight for THAT metric (i.e. their
 *     freshest/least-aged observation about the peer for that metric's half-life). This is load-
 *     bearing, not cosmetic: `MadliVectorIndex`'s invariant B allows up to
 *     `MAX_TRACKED_DAYS_PER_OBSERVER_PEER` (128) distinct-`epochDay` vectors per
 *     `(observer, observedPeer)` pair, and `MadliGossip.onGossipMessage`'s validator deliberately
 *     never checks `epochDay` against wall-clock time (see that class's doc comment on validator
 *     determinism) - so invariant B alone does not stop an attacker from fabricating and gossiping
 *     128 backdated vectors about a target peer in a single burst. Without this per-observer cap,
 *     folding every one of those 128 vectors into the median as an independent sample would
 *     multiply that one observer's effective influence by `sum_{d=0}^{127} 0.5^(d / halfLife)` -
 *     roughly 10.6x for a 7-day half-life, 41.5x for 30 days, 81.7x for 90 days - letting a single
 *     NON-majority observer outweigh many genuinely independent honest observers who each
 *     published only their one truthful vector for today. Capping each observer to one
 *     representative sample per metric closes that gap structurally: no matter how many
 *     distinct-day vectors an observer has tracked, they can never contribute more than one
 *     vector's worth of weight to any single metric - vector VOLUME stops being a lever, leaving
 *     only genuine Veritas-weighted headcount (defense 1) and report accuracy (defense 2) as
 *     manipulation surfaces. See `MadliAggregatorTest`'s backdated-flooding regression test (the
 *     module's read-time closure of `MadliVectorIndex`'s invariant B doc comment) and
 *     `MadliSybilResistanceSimulationTest` for the adversarial simulation proving all three
 *     defenses hold against a synthetic Sybil cluster and a selective-service attacker, plus the
 *     documented residual (a trusted MAJORITY that lies still wins the median - an explicitly
 *     accepted, tested boundary, not a silent gap; that scenario is about genuine headcount among
 *     DISTINCT observers with one vector each, orthogonal to this defense).
 *
 * Each metric is decayed by **its own** half-life ([MadliHalfLives]), so one vector contributes
 * with a different weight to each of the five output fields - correct, since Reachability ages
 * fast while Delivery-Integrity ages slow. A consequence of defense 3 above: the SAME observer may
 * have a different "representative vector" selected for different metrics, if their tracked
 * vectors' `epochDay`s differ in a way that changes which one is freshest under that metric's own
 * half-life - expected and correct, since each metric's recency-relevance is independent.
